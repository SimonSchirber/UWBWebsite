# Abstract

Current estimates expect the number of IoT devices to hit 30 Billion by 2025 assuming continous exponential growth [1]. Considering the rapid growth of IoT devices, the number of devices that each individual user owns also continues to grow. This increase in devices per user makes it continuously harder for users to manage and control their devices in an intuitive way. The goal of the project is to create a localization and orientation techniques for detecting and controlling smart device objects in a room via pointer control using only the sensors available in current smartphones. The project uses IMU and UWB sensors to predict object pose and orientation estimations. Using these estimations we are able to reliably detect objects with known positions in a room with pointing a controller at the device and display the predictions in a GUI interface.
